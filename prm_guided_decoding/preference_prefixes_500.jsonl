I'm really curious!"}, {"role": "user", "content": " So basically, if you have an error that shows up, like in your console, for example, the computer program will shut down. But sometimes you can expect errors to happen. So if you expect errors to happen, you can tell the computer not to shut down if they see them and how to handle them instead. For example, if you're running a division program in the calculator, if someone divides by zero, the calculator doesn't shut down. Instead, it will give you an error that you can't divide by zero. So that's the exception handling is you have the try phase where you can try and if the try doesn't happen then you have another block that is the exception block and this exception will be what will happen if your try block fails. And then there's also the finally block which runs however so if you're trying to close an application for example the finally block always has to get executed."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's a really good start! You've got the basic idea - exception handling helps our program continue running even when errors occur.\n\nI like your calculator example.

And then you would put return or print output, right? Etc. etc. Whatever, print x, for example. Then you have an accept block. You could have an accept block specific to a divided by zero error or just any other error, right?
